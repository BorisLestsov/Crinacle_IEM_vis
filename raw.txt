C=	Creative Aurvana Trio	250	Warm	Surprising lack of BA timbre, but still rather average in technicalities.	3BA	ConnectIT demo unit	
C=	Earsonics SM3		Warm	Non-fatiguing, relaxing listen. "Normal".	3BA	AV One demo unit	
C=	Elysian Eros	400	Warm	Typical "dual driver" sound. Not very impressive.	2BA	Showfloor demo unit	
C=	FiiO F5	65	V-shaped	Typical chifi V-shaped sound, nothing much to report on.	DD	E1 demo unit	
C=	FitEar Air 2/Titan	1700	Warm V-shape	Generic hybrid sound. Doesn't really perform up to par either.	1BA 1DD	Jaben SG demo unit	
C=	Focal Sphear	150	Mild V-shape	Good timbre, good bass and well-balanced tuning.	DD	Zeppelin & Co demo unit	
C=	Fostex TE100	1800	Warm neutral	A little boring and dead in dynamics. Not fun but not really reference either. Average.	1BA 1DD	Zeppelin & Co demo unit	
C=	iBasso IT01	110	V-shaped	Nothing really stands out as "excellent" to me, but it does a lot of things well and little wrong.	DD	Zeppelin & Co demo unit	
C=	Intime Sora	45	U-shaped	Well controlled bass boost with slightly skewed tonality. Potential is there.	DD	Third party unit	
C=	JH Billie Jean	350	V-shaped	Follows the JH house sound but otherwise nothing special.	2BA	AV One demo unit	
C=	JH Michelle	500	Warm	Still sounds typically "JH" with a slightly V tuning, with slower transients and a non-fatiguing signature.	3BA	Zeppelin & Co demo unit	
C=	JVC HA-FW01	380	Dark	Very heavy and very dark sounding IEM whose signature marrs technical ability slightly.	DD	Zeppelin & Co demo unit	
C=	Kinera Odin	800	Neutral	Sounds like a rather basic tuning and a resolution not fitting of its driver count.	8BA	Zeppelin & Co demo unit	
C=	Lear LCM-BD4.2	1030	Bright V-shape	Harsh, overly-textured and extremely fatiguing. Excellent technical ability completely shut down by tuning and timbre mismatch.	4BA 2DD	Treoo demo unit	
C=	Massdrop x NuForce EDC3	100	Neutral	Well tuned, though not the most technical nor the most natural sounding.	3BA	Review unit	
C=	MEE Pinnacle P1	200	Warm V-shape	Upper midrange emphasis with soft, warm bass. Nice for mainstream listening.	DD	Zeppelin & Co demo unit	
C=	NuForce HEM1	150	Neutral	Reference tuning with tonal balance. Unfortunately limited by its technicalities.	BA	E1 demo unit	
C=	Shanling ME100	120	V-shaped	An odd take on the typical "chifi DD" sound, rolling off the bass for extra clarity at the expense of tonality.	DD	Review unit	
C=	Shure SE535	500	Mid-centric	Tonally dead. One-note bass. No treble worth mentioning.	3BA	Stereo SG demo unit	
C=	Simgot EN700	100	Mid-centric	Good clarity and energetic signature.	DD	Zeppelin & Co demo unit	
C=	Stealthsonics U2	250	V-shaped	Sharp, emphasised treble and boosted bass, sounds more mainstream than audiophile.	1BA 1DD	Showfloor demo unit	
C=	Symphonium Audio Aurora	220	Warm neutral	Solid tuning, though average in technicalities.	2BA	Music Sanctuary demo unit	
C=	TFZ 5S	80	V-shaped	Warm and somewhat slow in transients. Good timbre, average tuning.	DD	LMUE demo unit	
C=	TFZ King	100	V-shaped	Better tuned than the 5S with a little extra treble which improves clarity and overall staging.	DD	LMUE demo unit	
C=	Tin Audio T2 Pro	50	Bright neutral	A T2 tuned with less sub-bass and more treble. High clarity but may not be for everyone.	2DD	Review unit	
C-	1More Quad Driver	200	"Balanced"	Okay-ish technical ability in a mainstream tuning. Can get congested.	3BA 1DD	Jaben Melbourne demo unit	
C-	AAW Nebula Two	150	U-shaped	Excellent clarity and wide staging due to semi-open design. DD bass manages to shine through.	1BA 1DD	Null Audio demo unit	
C-	Advanced Elise	30	Bassy	Boomy and heavy sounding. Smoothed over details but not the worst out there.	DD	Zeppelin & Co demo unit	
C-	Advanced GT3 Superbass	200	"Balanced"	Acceptable resolution though the tone is off in many ways. Filters don't seem to address that issue.	DD	Personal unit	
C-	Elysian Minerva	900	Warm V-shape	Wonky tone with blunted notes, not very revealing.	4BA	Showfloor demo unit	
C-	FiiO F3	25	U-shaped	Well-balanced U-shaped sound that's rather atypical of a chifi dynamic IEM.	DD	E1 demo unit	
C-	Fostex TE-02WP		Neutral-bright	Balanced and clear. Very good value.	DD	A2A Melbourne demo unit	
C-	Heygears Anora	80	Neutral with laid-back treble	Very good tuning, well-balanced signature.	BA	LMUE demo unit	
C-	Kinera Idun	140	V-shaped	Not a bad hybrid, considering Kinera's track record.	2BA 1DD	Third party unit	
C-	Oriveti Basic	100	Bassy	Lots of sub-bass rumble with an energetic midrange. Roll-off for non-fatigue.	DD	Jaben Melbourne demo unit	
C-	Sennheiser Momentum In-Ear	100	V-shaped	Fuzzy, typical V-shaped sound but nothing too egregious.	DD	Zeppelin & Co demo unit	
C-	Stealthsonics U4	500	Warm	An odd character, simultaneously bassy and thin at the same time.	4BA	Showfloor demo unit	
C-	Super Audio "Supermeme" 2BA+2DD	150	V-shaped	A decently tuned V-shaped hybrid with energetic upper midrange. May be intense for some.	2BA 2DD	Personal unit	
C-	Symphonium Audio Mirage	150	Dark	Typical single-BA sound that doesn't offer anything special.	BA	Music Sanctuary demo unit	
C-	Vive XE800	30	Mild V-shape	A mini GR07. Need I say more?	DD	Third party unit	
C-	Whizzer A-HE03 "Kylin"	160	Warm V-shape	Odd tonality and lacklustre technical ability overall.	2BA 1DD	Review unit	
C-	Westone 4R		Dark	Low resolution, extremely blunted and narrow imaging.	4BA	Third party unit

D+	Hifiman RE1000	1000	V-shaped	A strange take on a V response. Intense yet with no upper treble to speak of.	DD	A2A Melbourne demo unit	
D+	Kinera SEED	50	"Balanced"	Lacking in bass extension and tonally skewed too much to the higher frequencies.	1BA 1DD	Third party unit	
D+	Ultimate Ears UE5 Pro	600	Warm	Dead dynamics, overly warm and congested.	2BA	Jaben SG demo unit	
D+	Rose Mini2	110	Warm	It's somewhat natural in timbre but lacks a lot of technical proficiency.	2BA	Third party unit	
D=	AAW A1D	180	V-shaped	Sounds like a V-shaped dynamic. As anticlimactic as it sounds.	DD	Jaben SG demo unit

D=	Advanced M5-1D	400	V-shaped	Typical chifi DD sound. Nothing special.	DD	Zeppelin & Co demo unit	
D=	Ambient Acoustics AM16		"Balanced"	Sounds weird and is completely average in pure technicalities. Disappointing.	16BA	Zeppelin & Co demo unit	
D=	Ambient Acoustics AM24		"Balanced"	See above. Perhaps even slightly worse.	24BA	Zeppelin & Co demo unit

D=	Eternal Melody EM-2	290	V-shaped	It just sounds "meh" to be. Nothing much to say.	2BA	Zeppelin & Co demo unit

D=	Jomo Haka	365	Dark	Mushy, blobby and low resolution.	BA	Euphoria Audio demo unit

D=	Sound Linear Fitz 10 Flat	2200	"Balanced"	It sounds dead and boring. Nothing about it stands out at all and it doesn't even achieve the passing mark for technicalities.	10BA	E1 demo unit	
D=	TFZ 3S	65	V-shaped	It's okay. It's a Chinese dynamic IEM, nothing special.	DD	LMUE demo unit

E=	Unique Melody 3DD-Ti	700	Bright	It's not the quantity of the treble, but the quality. Reserved only for the most esoteric of tastes.	3DD	Stereo SG demo unit
